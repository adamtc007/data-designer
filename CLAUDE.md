## Project Overview

ü¶Ä **Hybrid Desktop/Web Data Designer** - Pure Rust desktop application with gRPC microservices architecture for designing, testing, and managing dynamic data transformation rules using a soft DSL system with comprehensive AI assistance.

### Key Features
- **Hybrid Architecture** - gRPC microservices with egui desktop client and future web support
- **Native egui GUI** - immediate mode, 60fps, dark theme with enhanced font rendering
- **gRPC Communication** - Type-safe Protocol Buffers with automatic fallback
- **Secure Key Management** - System keychain integration with gRPC API
- **Dynamic Grammar System** - EBNF-based soft DSL editable through UI
- **Advanced Parser** - nom-based parser with 6 extensions (arithmetic, strings, functions, lookups, runtime resolution, regex)
- **PostgreSQL Integration** - centralized database operations with vector embeddings
- **Configuration-Driven UI** - multi-layered Resource Dictionary with perspective switching
- **Complete AI Assistant System** - 7 AI features with gRPC-based API key management
- **RAG Integration** - Retrieval-Augmented Generation with database similarity search
- **Enhanced Code Editor** - Professional font rendering with syntax highlighting

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Pure Rust egui immediate mode GUI (`egui-frontend/`)
- **gRPC Server**: Financial taxonomy service with Protocol Buffers (`egui-frontend/grpc-server/`)
- **Shared Components**: Common UI library with gRPC client (`egui-frontend/shared-components/`)
- **Core Library**: Expression engine with database layer (`data-designer-core/`)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic similarity
- **Communication**: gRPC-first (port 50051) with database fallback (hybrid reliability)
- **Key Management**: System keychain with security command fallback
- **Build System**: Clean Cargo workspace

### Development Commands
```bash
# gRPC Server (run first)
cd egui-frontend/grpc-server && cargo run

# Desktop Client (gRPC-enabled)
cd egui-frontend && cargo run --release --bin data-designer-egui

# Development
cargo build                    # Build entire workspace
cargo test --all              # Run comprehensive test suite (16+ tests)
```
