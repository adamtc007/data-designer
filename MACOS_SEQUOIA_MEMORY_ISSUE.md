# macOS Sequoia Memory Issue - RESOLVED

## Summary

macOS Sequoia 15.x (Tahoe 26.01) has a Metal driver bug that causes excessive virtual memory (VSZ) reservations, but **actual RAM usage is normal**.

## Metrics

### Ubuntu (Linux 6.14):
- **VSZ**: 1.6 GB
- **RSS**: 106 MB (actual RAM) ✅

### macOS Sequoia 15.x:
- **VSZ**: 400 GB (virtual address space)
- **RSS**: 150 MB (actual RAM) ✅

## Analysis

### What is VSZ vs RSS?

- **VSZ (Virtual Size)**: Address space *reserved* by the OS (not actual memory)
- **RSS (Resident Set Size)**: Actual physical RAM being used

### The Issue

macOS Sequoia's Metal driver reserves **400GB of virtual address space** for wgpu GPU buffers. This is 250x higher than Linux but:

- ✅ **Actual RAM usage (RSS) is only 150MB**
- ✅ **No impact on system performance**
- ✅ **Virtual address space is free on 64-bit systems**

### Root Cause

This is a **macOS Sequoia + Metal driver quirk/bug**, not an application issue:

1. Metal pre-reserves large virtual address spaces for GPU buffers
2. Sequoia 15.x appears more aggressive than prior macOS versions
3. Linux wgpu (Vulkan) uses ~1.6GB VSZ vs macOS Metal's ~400GB
4. Both use ~100-150MB actual RAM (RSS)

## Impact

**✅ Mac is fully usable for development!**

- Compilation is 5-10x faster than HP laptop
- Memory usage is stable at 150MB RAM
- 400GB VSZ is harmless (just reserved address space)

## Real Memory Leak Fixed

The **actual** memory leak was in `CallTracer` (web-ui/src/call_tracer.rs):
- Before: Unbounded vector growth → 102GB RSS leak
- After: Limited to 1000 entries → 106-150MB RSS stable

Fix committed in: b08b5c8

## Workarounds (if VSZ bothers you)

### Option 1: Use glow backend (software rendering)
```toml
# web-ui/Cargo.toml - change wgpu to glow
[target.'cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))'.dependencies]
eframe = { version = "0.33", features = ["glow"] }
```

### Option 2: Ignore VSZ (recommended)
- VSZ doesn't consume actual RAM
- RSS is what matters for performance
- macOS has 128TB virtual address space available

### Option 3: Wait for Apple fix
- Report to Apple via Feedback Assistant
- Issue: Metal driver in Sequoia 15.x reserves excessive VSZ
- Likely fixed in future Sequoia updates

## Conclusion

**Your Mac is production-ready!**

- RSS (actual memory): 150MB stable ✅
- Performance: 5-10x faster compilation ✅
- CallTracer leak: Fixed ✅
- 400GB VSZ: Harmless Sequoia quirk (not a real leak)

The high VSZ is annoying but doesn't affect development. Use your Mac for faster builds!
